# OTP-generator
OTP generation using firebase
# OTP-generator without recaptcha
 Currently 'Android Device Verification' API is Removed by Google and merged with 'Google Play Integrity API'.
I already enabled the 'Google Play Integrity API', Plus I added my device SHA1 and SHA-256 both in the Firebase console and add the update google-service.json in the project.
Still, I am getting the Re-Captcha screen.
